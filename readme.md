MODEL DOCTOR FOR DIAGNOSING AND TREATING SEGMENTATION ERROR
--------

## Abstract

Despite the remarkable progress in semantic segmentation tasks with the advancement of deep neural networks, existing U-shaped hierarchical typical segmentation networks still suffer from local misclassification of categories and inaccurate target boundaries. In an effort to alleviate this issue, we propose a Model Doctor for semantic segmentation problems. The Model Doctor is designed to diagnose the aforementioned problems in existing pre-trained models and treat them without introducing additional data, with the goal of refining the parameters to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

## Framework

![](./framework.png)

A synopsis of our proposed methodology, which is comprised of two facets: the semantic category treatment applied to the deep features $M_{D}$, and the regional boundary treatment applied to the shallow features $M_{S}$.
## Usage

### Installation
Our experimental environment is `python 3.8 & pytorch 1.12.1+cu113`. We strongly recommend you use `pytorch >= 1.11.0` for its less GPU memory consumption. 
```python
  argparse
  albumentations == 1.3.0
  numpy
```

### Dataset
VOC2012 is used to validate our method [[百度网盘]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vkk3lMheUm6IjTXznlg7Ng?pwd=44mk).

The directory structure is as follows: 
```
VOCdevkit/
  ├── VOC2012
    ├── ImageSets/
    ├── JPEGImages/
    └── SegmentationClassAug/
```

### Training

```bash   
python finetune_seg.py \
--num_classes 21 \
--batch_size 8 \
--lr 1e-3 \

```

## How to integrate into your model

The segdoctor contains two parts: semantic category therapy, and regional boundary therapy.

For details, you can refer to our code. Reference *uet_resnet.py spixel.py* select appropriate features for semantic therapy and boundary therapy.
